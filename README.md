```Console
*** After working for 39 hours on a single bug...
-------------------------------------------------
- I studied/followed:
$ practical-aspnetcore/grpc.
$ Microsoft docs on how to "Create a gRPC client and server in ASP.NET Core"
$ Docs on how to "Configure endpoints for the ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server"
$ Docs on how to "Start ASP.NET Core gRPC app on macOS"
$ Other Microsoft docs related to gRPCs...
$ Using Docker...
$ Nearly all the StackOverflow questions, I thought related to the bug.
$ Good amount of Articles.
$ Every single line Bassel and Younes wrote!
```

### The bug:
On Mac OS,  Kestrel doesn't support HTTP/2 with TLS. The solution was mentioned in the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/troubleshoot?view=aspnetcore-6.0#unable-to-start-aspnet-core-grpc-app-on-macos). But, that solution made me get "This site canâ€™t be reached; localhost refused to connect;" when I navigate to "/". Instead of getting "This server contains a gRPC service".

> The above error made me doubt every single line in the code.

While the cause of the bug was that, the solution proposed by the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/troubleshoot?view=aspnetcore-6.0#unable-to-start-aspnet-core-grpc-app-on-macos) enforces HTTP/2 and prevents the fall back to HTTP/1.1. Consequently, that explains why I was getting "This site canâ€™t be reached; localhost refused to connect;" because chrome was using "HTTP/1.1". The "/" root was my way to determine if the backend gRPC service running or not, that is why I haven't tested the backend with a client or else I would have discovered the bug earlier.

### How I discovered the bug?
> Went for a walk today at 01:00 AM to get some fresh air, as soon as I returned and opened my laptop, Vola! 

It was not even a bug, I just choose the wrong metrics to determine if my gRPC server is running!
